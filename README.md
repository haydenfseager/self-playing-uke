# üé∏ Self-Playing-Uke
This is a Python project that allowed me to **automatically play a ukulele** by using the Python library [Mido](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

*Note:* This is merely the code for the project. This took months to manufacture a mechanical working product to accompany it.
